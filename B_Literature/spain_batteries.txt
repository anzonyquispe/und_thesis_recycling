maximise the separate collection of waste batteries
th information campaigns should be designed on the basis of specific and individual information
recycling campings should take into consideration the local conditions and cultural, situational or demographic factors of the households addressed.
this behavior is influenced by socio-economic variables, degree of environmental concern, level of knowledge about environmental recycling issues and social norms

Education, income, age, gender, household characteristics, environmental concerns, origin of individuals, norms, show social desirable behavior.

positive education's impact (Hadjimanolis, 2013; Czajkowski et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2014) No significant(Sidique et al., 2010; Rioux, 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Pearson et al., 2012). 

Several authors report a significant and positive correlation  between age and recycling behavior (Hage et al., 2009; Sidique et  al., 2010; Hadjimanolis, 2013; Keramitsoglou and Tsagarakis, 2013). no significant Czajkowski et al., 2014). F



e. Most studies found that income and recycling have a significant correlation (Nnorom et al., 2009; Gellynck et al., 2011; Hadjimanolis, 2013; Czajkowski et al., 2014; Zen et al., 2014; Babaei et al., 2015), whilst some few works have reported no correlation (Hansmann et al., 2006; Hage et al., 2009; Rioux, 2011; Pearson et al., 2012). However, this correlation is ambiguous.  Several works indicate that households with higher income recycle more than households with lower incomes (Nnorom et al., 2009; Czajkowski et al., 2014; Zen et al., 2014). In contrast, other works show that households with higher income not necessarily have a rate of recycling higher than other households (Hage and  Söderholm, 2008; Gellynck et al., 2011). Regarding gender, some studies consider that this variable has not a relevant influence on recycling behavior (Hansmann et al., 2006; Hage et al., 2009; Sidique et al., 2010). Nevertheless, several works have found evidence that women are more likely to recycle than men (Chung and Poon, 1996; Pearson et al., 2012; Hadjimanolis, 2013; Babaei et al., 2015). Among household characteristics included in previous research, we can note, household size (Tadesse, 2009; Wan et al., 2014), marital status (Sidique et al., 2010; Pearson et al., 2012), or the type of house (Hage et al., 2009; Sidique et al., 2010; Zen et al., 2014), among others 


the origin of the individuals have become more common (Hage et al., 2009; Pearson et al., 2012; Zen et al., 2014). The relationship with the economic activity is also analyzed recently in some works (Omran et al., 2009; Babaei et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2015).

. It is well documented that environmental concern affects recycling behavior positively (Hornik et al., 1995; Hage and Söderholm, 2008; Hage et al., 2009; Nnorom et al., 2009; Refsgaard and Magnussen, 2009; Tadesse, 2009; Best and Kneip, 2011). no significant relationship or a very weak relationship between this variable and recycling behavior (Barr et al., 2001; Tonglet et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2011).

recycling behavior of households and their knowledge about specific recycling issues (Hansmann et al., 2006; Sidique et al., 2010;
Hadjimanolis, 2013; Keramitsoglou and Tsagarakis, 2013; Nguyen
et al., 2015).

In this context, several works conclude that person’s interest to show a social desirable behavior (i.e. a pro-environmental behavior) is positively linked to recycling behavior (Hornik et al., 1995; Chu and Chiu, 2003; Sidique et al., 2010; Rioux, 2011; Videras et al., 2012; Czajkowski et al., 2014; Wan et al., 2014; Zen et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015). In contrast, some few studies report that social norms have not relevant influence on  recycling (Chan, 1998; Knussen et al., 2004; Hage et al., 2009).

New documents take into account specific waste materials and how factors affect their behavior. it is useful in designing the most effective educational and information campaings

to measure environmental awareness of individuals
• Are you concerned about the environment?
• Have you detected any environmental problem in your surroundings  during the previous year?
• Have youhad knowledge of any environmental protectionawareness campaign in the last year?
